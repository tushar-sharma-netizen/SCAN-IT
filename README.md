An improvement of Arogya Setu app which restricts movement of users having history of contact with covid positive users
An improvement of Aarogya Setu app which restricts movement of users having history of contact with covid positive users, basically a close contact detector with the infected users for all the past activities done by another user and thereby restricting their movements.
Our app basically provides every end user who visits public places such as Malls, restaurants, shops, etc. an option to generate a QR code which will be compulsorily required by them in order to use any public facility or visit any public place. This is done by first registering in the app with the help of our phone number and then providing details such as name, address, whether the user is suffering from coronavirus or not and whether the user is a public facility provider or an end user using these facilities. After filling these details, a QR code will be generated for the end users which needs to be scanned by every user who is a public facility provider whenever a particular end user visits a public place or uses a public facility owned by the respective public facility provider. If an end user gives “Yes” i.e. he/she is suffering from coronavirus at the time of filling the details, then after scanning the QR code, an alert with “Not safe” will be given and if the user gives “No”, then after scanning the QR code, an alert with “Safe” will be given. After scanning, the phone number of the end user with the “Safe” status, the public facility provider and timestamp of scanning the QR code is saved in the database and hence, this end user is allowed to use the public facility. At a later time, if our app gets to know from the hospital database app that a particular user who is registered in our app with status as “Safe” is found corona positive then immediately, the status will be changed to “Not safe” for this user and for all other users who were scanned by all the public facility providers who had scanned this particular end user in the past two days. This will restrict the end users who are “Not safe” from visiting public places, and using public facilities. This is an improvement to Aarogya Setu app as Aarogya Setu app just gives information to the users whether they have come in contact with a covid patient recently or not and just warns them which can still make things worse if the end user still visits public places and affect others as it does not restrict them from further exposure to coronavirus which is done by our app. Later on, we will also try to just block the option to generate the QR code for those particular users who are corona positive rather than just showing alert as “Not safe”.
This facility can be extended to public transports like Auto, Bus, Airports or Railway stations at a later date with increase in funding and popularity of our app and after getting required permissions from the government. This could be done in such a way that people travelling or even entering airports or railway stations can be made to quarantine themselves for 14 days or so depending on the situation or severity of spread, so basically the users have to get their QR codes get scanned during check in or boarding just like boarding passes and on a later date if another person is found positive with the infection all the other users or travellers who have used the facility during that period of time with the infected users are advised to stay home and their movement is restricted completely by blocking their QR codes. And these users are given with all the emergency realted information for fighting with the virus and their health status could be tracked for the nest 14 days and if they are not found with any symptoms they would be allowed to move out of their homes or quarantine centers, but on the other hand if they feel they might be infected their details could be shared with the government approved laboratories or hospitals for a hastle free checkup and treatment
